# HiLives Platform

Repository created with the aim of disseminating the prototype created within the scope of the O2 of the HiLives project. The final product can be previewed via the following link: http://apphilives.web.ua.pt

This is an Erasmus+ project, which aims to deepen knowledge and share practices in the inclusion of PWD in higher education and their transition to an active and independent life. To this end, it explores the role of digital media throughout this process, with a view to developing strategies and tools to support the personal, academic and socio-professional development of PWD in the context of Higher Education and the labour market.

Regarding O2, the main goal was the development of a prototype of a Digital Tool for the Recommendation of opportunities in Higher Education Institutions (HEI) and in the labour market for PWD. This tool aims to bridge gaps and mismatches between the expectations, skills and needs of these people in two different environments.
